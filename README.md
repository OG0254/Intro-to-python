# 🧮 Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It performs basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Practice creating Python programs using:
  - Arithmetic operations
  - String manipulation
  - Variables
  - Data types
  - User input

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input two numbers.
2. It then asks the user to choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
3. Based on the input, it performs the selected operation.
4. Finally, it prints the full expression and result (e.g., `10 + 5 = 15`).

---

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
```

---

## 📁 Requirements

- Python 3.x

---

## 💡 Features

- Handles basic math operations
- Uses `float()` to allow decimal input
- Includes simple error handling (e.g. division by zero)
- Displays results in an easy-to-read format

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the script with any name you like for instance `basic.py`.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python basic.py
   ```
